    <h2>Introduction</h2>

Cryptos have been selling books to the public as we have said in our previous project, and they want ways to digitize their business and sell their products online and promote their business.<br> In this Phase, we have updated some sections and added some sections such as the user manual and the programmer’s manual all to provide more information about how our system works.<br>
Our Overview has been updated to provide the user with brief information on how our application works and what it can do. <br>The updated use case diagram shows the interaction between the user and the system. The updated description table shows what the digital book ordering system can do. Updated user and system requirements both will show what is required by the system and the user. <br>The user manual shows the instructions per page of our applications to further help the user to understand our application.<br> The programmer’s manual will show the program code and provide the information needed by a programmer to understand how the program works.<br>

<h2>Overview</h2>

Crypto’s book selling app will give our beloved book lovers the will to browse their favorite books from their authors whether it be digital or hardcopy books, and they get to do all this at the comfort of their own homes.<br> This will help lessen the havoc of having to go stand in long slow queues and having to end up not being attended to due to too many people being at the shop.<br> This will also help the store as less customers will be doing walk-ins which means they can attend to everyone without having the fear of experiencing system failure due to too many people being there. Our system will also be open for 24 hours which means that the user can shop at any desired time without having to worry about the shop closing or try to cover business hours.<br>
The system will capture and store data that is entered by the user to avoid having to enter their details every time they are using the system and the system having to capture it at all those times. <br>The system will also give the users the freedom to contact us at any time should they experience an error while using the system.<br>

<h2>problem statement</h2>

User requires a system that will be easy to understand, use and that will also that save time.<br> Digital books ordering system is meant to make life easy by introducing advanced life of eBooks.<br>
Book stores for a long time have been the only way we can buy books, going to the bookstore is a pleasant experience because you get to browse through all your favorite books and get to choose the book you want after browsing through it, but it has become very frustrating thing in the past year.<br> Physically going to the bookstore is now frustrating because lots of people are now buying books and that causes long lines.<br> Another frustrating thing is face to face contact with people, as we are from the pandemic and going out has been a risk especially going to stores where you are in close contact with people.<br>
The proposal of digitalized books minimizes books lost and saves space, because books can accept a lot of space in your home and as well, it prevents books from getting damaged and it also saves time and traveling costs that we used when we go to bookstores.<br>
Online book ordering system has been introduced to us and we now can order hardcopy book and digital books in the comfort of our homes.<br>
